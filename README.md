# Call taxation
by Jo√£o Carlos (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaocarlosvale/)

This project consists of an application to calculate the total cost for calls registered in a 
file of calls and following some rules:
- The first 5 minutes of each call are billed at 5 cents per minute
- The remainer of the call is billed at 2 cents per minute
- The caller with the highest total call duration of the day will not be charged 
(i.e., the caller that has the highest total call duration among all of its calls)
